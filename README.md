# midi_matrix_modulator
*USAGE*
  * Python 2.7 environment
  * sudo pip install music21

*2018-4-21*
  * Python 2.7
  * Principles of discrete math* applied to music in midi format
  * Matrix transposition, addition, subtraction, multiplication (and other fun stuff to build upon)
  * Incorporating music21 lib (which means I should port over to py3 eventually)
  * TODO complete multiplication function
  * TODO continue filling out custom chords / scales dictionary (will probably prompt usr to ask if they want to enter notes individually or as chord_names)
  * TODO ref http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_08_installingMusicXML.html (setup xmlMusicPath to get chords to display on traditional staves)
  * *Note: midi files in this repo are randomly assigned notes for purposes of debugging*
